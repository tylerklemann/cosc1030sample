Long ago, the world of Eldoria was held together by four ancient relics, 
each controlling a force of nature - Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. As long as these 
relics remained intact, balance and peace reigned.

That peace was shattered when a powerful warlord, Malagar, set out to claim the relics 
for himself. One by one, he destroyed them, stealing their energy and unleashing chaos. 
The land is now in ruinsâ€”fires rage out of control, storms never end, and entire cities have 
been swallowed by the sea.

But there is hope.hjhj hBefore the last relic fell, a guardian hid a small piece of its power, 
waiting for someone brave enough to restore what was lost. That someone...

IS YOU. 

You wake up in the ruins of an ancient temple, holding the only surviving fragment of the relics. 
You don't know why you were chosen, but one thing is clear - you're the only one who can stop Malagar 
before it's too late.

To do that, you'll have to travel across the broken world, find the lost pieces of the relics, 
and bring back the balance before Malagar becomes unstoppable.

The world is on the edge of destruction. Will you step up and save it?
